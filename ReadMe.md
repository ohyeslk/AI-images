a remote viewing application powered by an alien psyche.

Point your camera at the world around you. Harnessing cutting-edge artificial neural network technology, AI • Image generates automatic textual descriptions of the objects it sees.

How does it work?

AI • Image transmits a 2D matrix of brightness values across time and space to a remote viewing algorithm housed in an undisclosed location somewhere in the state of Oregon.

The matrix is subject to rigorous mathematical analysis that scientists have yet to fully comprehend. The detector system has no direct knowledge of objects in the world (donuts, bananas, skateboards, wine glasses, etc) as we know them. Instead, the detector maps patterns received on the signal line to a sequence of word-choice probability distributions and assembles an output stream. The internal routing through this artificial neural network is largely meaningless to a human observer. Nonetheless, it works (sometimes)!

This is the practice of looking into a translucent ball or other material with the belief that things can be seen, such as spiritual visions, or for purposes of divination or fortune-telling ... Although it is most commonly done with a crystal ball, it may also be performed using any smooth surface, such as a bowl of liquid, a pond, or a crystal.
